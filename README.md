### Aim: To design an AI-powered chatbot that assists customers in resolving issues related to product troubleshooting, order tracking, and general inquiries. The chatbot should handle various customer queries efficiently while maintaining a conversational and user-friendly tone. In this experiment, we will employ different prompt patterns to guide the development process of the chatbot, ranging from basic task-oriented prompts to more complex, persona-driven prompts. Case study 1 with Straightforward Prompts, Tabular Format Prompting and Preceding Question Prompting  

### Explanation - Any one use case from Unit 5 and generate the report for that with the unit 2 Prompt type
Procedure:
1.	Define the Scenario and Use Case:
Scenario:
Universities are increasingly seeking reliable and automated solutions to manage classroom attendance. By implementing a biometric tracking system using fingerprint or facial recognition, institutions can eliminate manual roll calls, prevent proxy attendance, and ensure accurate logging of student presence. This system enhances administrative efficiency, supports real-time data access, and strengthens academic integrity across departments.
Target Audience:
Higher education institutions—particularly universities and colleges with large student populations and frequent lectures—looking to modernize attendance management in disciplines like engineering, medicine, and business studies where precision and accountability are critical.
## Procedure:
1.	Straightforward Prompts:
    - 	"Define Arithmetic Operations in one sentence."
    - 	"List two advantages of regular exercise."
 3.	Tabular Format Prompting:
     •	"Give advantages and Disadvantages of Drinking Juices daily in a table."
     •	"Provide a table listing five programming languages, their paradigms, and one use case each."
3. Preceding Question Prompting:
    •	"Why is climate change a global concern? Explain how greenhouse gases contribute to global warming."
    •	"How do motors work? Describe the process of power generation in simple terms."
4. Missing Word Prompting:
    •	"My name ____ Koti."
    •	"In a playground, the kids ____ ready to play."


## Use Case:

* System: Biometric Attendance Tracking System for University Classrooms
* Primary Actor: Students attending scheduled lectures
* Secondary Actor:  Faculty members and administrative staff managing attendance records
* Goals: Automate attendance logging to reduce manual errors and save faculty time
* Stakeholders: - University Dean, Head of Academic Affairs
- Preconditions: Students are enrolled in courses and have registered their biometric data
- Trigger: A student enters the classroom and scans their fingerprint or ID at the start of the lecture

## Straightforward Prompts

Prompt 1:

```
Explain in one sentence how a student can mark attendance using the biometric system.
```

### Output:
```
A student can mark attendance by scanning their fingerprint or face at the biometric device installed in the classroom.
```

Prompt 2:

```
List three benefits of using biometric attendance in universities.
```

### Output:
```
– Eliminates proxy attendance  
– Saves faculty time on manual tracking  
– Provides real-time attendance data to administration  
```

## Tabular Format Prompting

Prompt 1:

```
Create a table showing the differences between Biometric, RFID Card, and Manual attendance methods including accuracy, effort, and risk of proxy.
```

### Output:

```
| Method         | Accuracy     | Effort Required | Proxy Risk        |
| -------------- | ------------ | --------------- | ----------------- |
| Biometric      | High         | Low             | Very Low          |
| RFID Card      | Medium       | Low             | Moderate          |
| Manual Sign-in | Low          | High            | High              |
```

Prompt 2:

```
Provide a table comparing three student verification methods (Fingerprint, Face Recognition, Student ID) used during attendance logging including speed and reliability.
```

### Output:

```
| Verification Method | Speed         | Reliability | Typical Use                        |
| ------------------- | ------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Fingerprint         | Instant       | High        | Classroom entry and attendance     |
| Face Recognition    | Fast          | High        | Automated attendance at entry gate |
| Student ID Card     | Moderate      | Medium      | Backup method or manual override   |
```

## Preceding Question Prompting

Prompt 1:

```
What documents must students submit to register for biometric attendance? Explain why these are needed.
```

### Output:
```
Students must submit a valid university ID and biometric data (fingerprint or facial scan).  
These are needed to uniquely identify each student and prevent impersonation during attendance logging.
```

Prompt 2:

```
How can the system guide a first-time student through biometric registration? Describe the steps simply.
```

### Output:
```
The system can guide the student through:

1. Welcome screen explaining biometric setup  
2. Prompt to enter student ID and personal details  
3. Capture fingerprint or facial scan  
4. Confirm identity and link to student profile  
5. Display confirmation message with usage instructions  
```

## Missing Word Prompting

Prompt 1:

```
The most secure method for classroom attendance is ____ verification.
```

### Output:
```
Biometric verification
```

Prompt 2:

```
To prevent proxy attendance, universities can use ____ scanning.
```

### Output:
```
Fingerprint scanning
```

## Conclusion

By applying Straightforward, Tabular Format, Preceding Question, and Missing Word Prompting techniques to the biometric attendance use case, the AI generated clear, reliable, and student-friendly outputs that support the design of a more efficient and secure classroom attendance system.

## Result

The various types of prompts were executed successfully.
